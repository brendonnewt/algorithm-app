# Algorithms in Rust

An **algorithm** is a procedure used for solving a problem or performing a computation. Algorithms act as an exact list of instructions that conduct specified actions step by step in either hardware- or software-based routines.

This project is designed to walk through some simple algorithms in Rust, and to document said algorithms so that they can be used as notes/study materials.

## Project Plan

The plan is to implement many popular algorithms and eventually provide a UI that can be used to run the algorithms on desired inputs to observe and study the output.

## Documentation

To view the full documentation for this project, including **time complexities** and other helpful notes about the algorithms:

1) Clone or fork this project
2) Run the command `cargo doc --open`

### Note: This was developed on Mac OS

## Sources

The following resources were used for studying the algorithms and providing notes in the documentation:

- **[TechTarget](https://www.techtarget.com/whatis/definition/algorithm)**: Provides the definition of an algorithm.

- **[Programiz](https://www.programiz.com)**: A comprehensive resource for learning programming concepts and algorithms.
